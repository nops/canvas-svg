# canvas-svg

Fork of Robin Berjon's [archived Google Code repo](https://code.google.com/archive/p/canvas-svg/).

This is a set of related components that make canvas and SVG play together more. Notably, it allows you to save a canvas 2D context as SVG, and to have an SVG mirror of a canvas context.
